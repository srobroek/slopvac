# An override that sets only `severity` keeps the profile's threshold. Unlike a
# Vale rule line, a setting here belongs to the block it is written in, so
# appending to the end of this file cannot silently re-target it.

# --- Spelling ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The spelling check is generated from this setting, so one variant table serves
# every direction and en-US -> en-GB cannot disagree with en-GB -> en-US.
#
# ASD-STE100 asks for American spelling, which is why en-US is the default rather
# than a rule a British English project cannot turn off. `und` disables the
# spelling check and leaves the rest of its category running.
[locale]
default = "en-US"        # en-US | en-GB | und
# Words this project spells its own way whatever the locale. CSS and web platform
# identifiers are already protected, so this is for your own API surface.

# A locale can be set per path, which is what a translated docs tree needs.
# [[overrides]]
# files = ["docs/en-gb/**/*.md"]
# [overrides.locale]
# default = "en-GB"

# --- Word blocklist ----------------------------------------------------------
# OFF until you point at a file. No word list ships with this package, and the
# word-choice rules check nothing while this is unset.
#
# Each entry names a word, the part of speech it is refused as, and a reason. The
# part of speech is the point: `deploy` is a good verb and a bad noun, so "the
# deploy failed" is flagged and "deploy the worker" is not. The file is refused if
# any entry has no `reason`, because nobody can review a refusal that gives none.
#
# A word absent from the file is fine BY DEFINITION. There is no "only these words
# are allowed" setting: this package shipped an ASD-STE100 list enforced that way,
# and on ordinary software prose it reported 828 words whose only fault was having
# no entry. Copy examples/blocklist.toml and cut what you disagree with.
#
# [vocabulary]
# path = "docs/blocklist.toml"     # relative to THIS file; .yml and .json load too

# --- Categories --------------------------------------------------------------
# Turn one off, or demote it to advisory. A category cap LOWERS a rule's
# severity and never raises it, so setting `severity = "error"` here will not
# promote a suggestion into a gate failure.
#
# [categories.prose-scope]
# severity = "warning"       # worth seeing, not worth blocking
#
# [categories.ai-tells-formatting]
# max_per_100_words = 2.0    # this project uses tables heavily

# --- Single rules ------------------------------------------------------------
# Give every override a reason. The next reader needs to know whether it holds.
#
# [rules."prose-format.no-unicode-dash"]
# severity = "off"           # house style uses real em dashes

# --- Path overrides ----------------------------------------------------------

# in file order, so put the general case first and the specific case after.

# Reference material and runbooks earn the strict tier.

# own rules run natively, so nothing is checked twice. When `vale` is absent the
# run reports those rules as UNCHECKED rather than passing them silently.
