# Steering generation

What `docs/agents/` holds in a scaffolded repository, and which parts a
generator owns.

## Layout

One directory per concern. Each has an index, and concerns that vary by language
have one leaf per language.

```
docs/agents/
  index.md                    commands, toolchain pins, layout, structural tool
  conventions.md              error handling, logging, ownership boundaries
  quality/index.md
  quality/{rust,python,ts,go,terraform,cross-cutting}.md
  ci/index.md
  ci/{github,gitlab}.md
  release/index.md
  testing/index.md
  docs/index.md
  env/index.md
```

Adding a language adds `quality/<lang>.md` plus one line in its index. No existing
file grows.

## Ownership

| Path | Generated | Hand-written |
|---|---|---|
| `index.md` | all | none |
| `quality/*` | what each tool enforces, and the command | why a rule is off |
| `ci/*` | job graph, merge gates, local reproduction | none |
| `release/index.md` | tool, tag format, publish targets | pull request title rules |
| `testing/index.md` | test directories, runners, single-test invocation | what is expected before review |
| `docs/index.md` | topology, deploy trigger, generated versus authored | none |
| `env/index.md` | variable names from CI and configuration | what fails without each |
| `conventions.md` | none | all |

Generated content sits between markers:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: quality-rust -->
<!-- END GENERATED -->
```

The generator replaces marked blocks and leaves everything else. A file with no
marker is never written after it is first created, which is why `conventions.md`
survives.

## Sources

| Output | Read from |
|---|---|
| `index.md` | rendered recipe set, `mise.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, workspace manifest |
| `quality/rust.md` | `clippy.toml`, `[lints]` in `Cargo.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`, `deny.toml` |
| `quality/python.md` | `ruff.toml`, type checker configuration |
| `quality/ts.md` | `biome.json`, `.oxlintrc.json` |
| `quality/go.md` | `.golangci.yml` |
| `quality/terraform.md` | `.tflint.hcl`, trivy configuration |
| `quality/cross-cutting.md` | `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `typos.toml`, cspell configuration |
| `ci/*` | the rendered workflow files |
| `release/index.md` | `release-please-config.json` or `cog.toml` |
| `testing/index.md` | test directories on disk, runner configuration |
| `env/index.md` | `env:` keys in workflows, `.env.example` |

`env/index.md` records names. Values never enter it.

## Index files

`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` stay an index. The `docs/agents` recipe writes
`AGENTS.md` from its own `AGENTS.body.md` and points `CLAUDE.md` at it with a
relative symlink, so one file serves both harnesses. The steering generator
never touches either: it rewrites marked blocks under `docs/agents/` alone.

Directory structure is not documented. gitnexus and repomix answer structural
questions, and `index.md` names which of the two this repository has.

### One statement per fact

A source belongs in `AGENTS.md` when it states something no other loaded source
states. The test is content, not count: two pointers to the same tool are fine
when each carries different content.

Beads is the worked example, and it cuts both ways.

`bd`'s own block is dropped. It restated the five commands `bd prime` prints,
and `bd prime` is what its native hooks already call on compaction. Measured on
this repository, the block was 54 of 90 lines. `AGENTS.md` names the prefix in
one line instead.

`~/.claude/rules/40-beads.md` stays. It points at a context file holding the
label-and-metadata conventions that `bd prime` has no knowledge of: routing by
`agent:<kind>` label with the assignee pinning an instance, `execution_*`
metadata set before spawn, git anchors, dedupe keys, `BD_JSON_ENVELOPE=1` for
anything parsing output, and that `git push` does not sync `refs/dolt/data`.
Upstream documents its CLI; that file documents the local conventions on top.

`AGENTS.md` is the only agent index. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, tracked by
git as mode `120000`, so a tool appending to `AGENTS.md` is visible through both
names and neither can drift from the other.

A block that survives this test is complete on its own. Removing one leaves the
rest accurate, and every row in the index table names a file that exists.

### Keeping tools out of AGENTS.md

```sh
bd init --prefix <p> --non-interactive --skip-hooks
rm CLAUDE.md && ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
# then replace the AGENTS.md body with the recipe's, keeping .codex/ untouched
```

`--skip-agents` is NOT used, because it also skips the codex lifecycle hooks that
keep beads context alive. `bd init` writes four of them to `.codex/hooks.json`
alongside `[features] hooks = true` in `.codex/config.toml`:

| Event | Matcher | Command |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | `startup\|resume\|clear` | `bd codex-hook SessionStart` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | none | `bd codex-hook UserPromptSubmit` |
| `PreCompact` | `manual\|auto` | `bd codex-hook PreCompact` |
| `PostCompact` | `manual\|auto` | `bd codex-hook PostCompact` |

Those hooks are what make dropping the `AGENTS.md` block safe: they reload
context after compaction without prose. Keeping them and replacing the prose is
therefore the order, not skipping both.

The generated `AGENTS.md` is 127 lines carrying three overlapping beads blocks,
and the `minimal` profile is not minimal, so the recipe overwrites the body.
`bd init --agents-template <file>` supplies it instead when the recipe prefers
that. `bd setup <recipe>` appends exactly one block and is idempotent on re-run.

`--skip-hooks` is equally required. Without it `bd init` copies the ambient hook
binaries from the configured `core.hooksPath` into `.beads/hooks`, repoints
`core.hooksPath` at the copy, and stages the result. Observed on macOS with a
hooks path owned by another tool: the copied `pre-commit` was 24MB with an
unusable arm64 slice, and every commit failed with `cannot execute binary file`.

`.beads/.gitignore` gets a `hooks/` line so a later `bd` invocation cannot stage
them either.

## Freshness

`just steering` regenerates in place. `just steering-check` regenerates into a
temporary directory and exits non-zero on a difference, naming each stale file
and the command that fixes it.

That check runs inside the quality job. A workflow of its own would be gated on
paths, and a workflow that never runs leaves a required check pending forever.

## Skills

| Skill | Reads | Writes | Network |
|---|---|---|---|
| `project-scaffold` | interview answers, recipes | a new repository | yes |
| `project-scaffold-update` | recipes, repository state | rendered files and marked blocks | yes |

Regenerating steering is a `just` recipe rather than a skill. `just steering` takes no
arguments and asks nothing, so given the same files on disk it produces the same
output, which is what lets `just steering-check` verify it in CI. Wrapping a
deterministic script in a skill would put a model in a decision that has none.

Both skills are plain markdown at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

`project-scaffold-update` handles a recipe a repository does not have yet, a
recipe change that landed after it was scaffolded, and a repository that predates
this tool. `copier update` cannot run here, because a recipe rendered from a
local path records no `_commit`. `scripts/scaffold.py update` re-renders at the
`_ref` that render recorded and merges the difference over local edits.

Duplication and token-budget judgements belong to the `audit-steering` skill.
The generator produces content and defers to it.
