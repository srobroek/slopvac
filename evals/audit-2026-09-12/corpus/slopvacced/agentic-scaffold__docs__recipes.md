# Recipes

31 recipes and 140 declared variables. Every variable listed here is asked or
derived; anything absent is fixed in the recipe per `../rules/choices.md`, and a
question whose answer the tree, the toolchain, or the generator already carries
is not asked at all.

## base

Renders first. `base/license` is separate from `base/repo` because `lang/rust`
reads its answers file for the SPDX identifier, and `_external_data` reads a
sibling recipe.

| Recipe | Writes | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `base/license` | `LICENSE` | `license`, `copyright_name` |
| `base/repo` | `README.md`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `docs/{adr,architecture}/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` | `project_name`, `description`, `org` |
| `base/gitignore` | `.gitignore`, from github/gitignore templates through `gh api` plus every `.gitignore.d/*` fragment | none |

`license` takes any licence identifier and fetches the body through
`gh api /licenses/<key>`. No text is vendored here, since a copy would drift from
the source.

GitHub keys are lowercase and do not always match the SPDX identifier:
`AGPL-3.0-only` is `agpl-3.0` there, so the recipe normalises `-only` and
`-or-later` before the call. `gh api /licenses/<key>` also serves identifiers
absent from the `/licenses` list, `EUPL-1.2` among them. Anything it refuses falls
back to the SPDX licence list, and an identifier absent from both fails while
listing what GitHub has. `none` does not write a file.

The template list follows from which language recipes rendered, plus
`Global/{macOS,Windows,Linux}` on every render. The operating system writes
`.DS_Store`, `._*`, `Thumbs.db`, and `*~` whatever the project is, and a docs-only
repository renders no language recipe to derive them from.

Editor directories are left out. `.vscode/` and `.idea/` follow the developer
rather than the project, so they belong in a global `core.excludesFile` rather than
in every repository this scaffolds.

`base/repo` creates `docs/` and nothing inside it. `docs/agents` and `docs/adr`
own their own subtrees.

`base/repo` carries the only `precheck.py`. It requires `git`, `just`, and
`gh`, notes `mise` and `prek` when absent, and refuses a destination with
uncommitted changes, because copier overwrites and does not leave a diff to review.

`base/gitignore` always ignores what a tool in the repository writes, meaning the
repomix pack and any generated skill directory.

A fragment opening with its own comment keeps it rather than gaining a second one.
The whole file is rebuilt from its sources each run, so two runs produce the same
bytes.

## lang

Each language recipe writes the same six kinds of file, which is what makes
adding a language a one-directory change.

```
lang/<name>/template/
  <tool configs>
  .gitignore.d/<name>
  .pre-commit.d/<name>.yaml
  .mise/conf.d/<name>.toml
  .just.d/<name>.just
  .github/workflows/wc-{lint,test}-<name>.yml
  .github/actions/setup-<name>/action.yml
  .gitlab/ci/<name>.yml
```

| Recipe | Tool configs | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `lang/rust` | `rust-toolchain.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`, `clippy.toml`, `deny.toml` | `crate_kind`, `rust_edition` |
| `lang/python` | `ruff.toml`, `pytest.ini`, `noxfile.py` | `python_version`, `python_layout`, `python_framework` |
| `lang/ts` | `tsconfig.json`, `biome.json`, `.oxlintrc.json`, `vitest.config.ts` | `node_version`, `ts_framework` |
| `lang/go` | `.golangci.yml`, `cmd/<name>/main.go` | `go_module_path`, `go_version` |
| `lang/api` | `openapi.yaml`, `.just.d/api.just`, the mise, hook, CI, and quality fragments | `api_title`, `api_version`, `api_server_url`, `api_ruleset`, `api_fail_severity`, `api_baseline_ref` |

`lang/ts` writes both `biome.json` and `.oxlintrc.json`. That pairing is fixed,
not a choice. When better-t-stack generated the project it already wrote
`biome.json` and `tsconfig.json`, so `lang/ts` guards both with
`_skip_if_exists` and contributes only the fragments and CI jobs.

`lang/api` uses vacuum for linting and oasdiff for breaking-change detection.
spectral renders only when a custom ruleset needs it.

Both tools ship a default that looks like a gate and is not one. `vacuum lint` exits 0
on warnings unless `--fail-severity` is passed, and a missing description or absent
`operationId` is reported at warn, so the recipe passes it. `oasdiff breaking` prints
every breaking change and exits 0 unless `--fail-on ERR` is passed. Measured against
vacuum 0.30.0 and oasdiff 1.26.1: removing an operation exited 0 bare and 1 with the
flag.

oasdiff installs through `ubi` rather than `aqua`, which carries no registry entry for
it.

The starter spec passes its own gate as rendered, which took four `example` blocks. It
scored 98 of 100 with four `missing examples` warnings until they were added, so the
scaffold failed the check it ships.

Only the lint runs at commit time. The breaking-change check reads the spec out of a
baseline ref, and a first commit on a fresh branch has no merge base, so it belongs in CI
where the pull request defines one. With no baseline reachable it exits 0 rather than
blocking the commit that introduces the contract.

`.gitignore.d/<name>` carries the conditional lines alone. The upstream templates
cover `/target`, `__pycache__`, and `node_modules`; what it cannot express is
`Cargo.lock` ignored for a library and committed for a binary, or `vendor/` under
Go vendor mode.

### In a monorepo

`just add <name> <lang>` renders the language recipe at the member path. A
language recipe therefore has two destination roots: the member directory for its
tool configs and its `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and the repository root for
`.mise/conf.d/`, `.just.d/`, and the CI files, which are repository-wide.

copier renders to one destination, so `add_member.py` renders into the member path and
moves the repository-wide directories up, merging into whatever is already there. Two
members both contribute a `.mise/conf.d/` entry, and moving the directory wholesale
would drop the first.

The member's hook fragment is promoted to a real `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. prek's
workspace mode reads one config per directory and namespaces the hooks
`<dir>:<hook-id>`, but it skips dot-prefixed directories while discovering, so a
`.pre-commit.d/` fragment alone is invisible and the member's hooks never run.

prek also caches which directories hold a config, so a member added afterwards stays
invisible until the cache is rescanned. `add_member.py` runs `prek list --refresh`
once, which is enough: verified against prek 0.4.11, where `prek list` showed only
root hooks beforehand and kept listing `packages/svc:ruff-format` after.

The same script registers the member with release-please when that recipe rendered, for
the same reason: `just add` is where the path becomes known, and release-please resolves
no globs.

CI stays inside the language recipe rather than in a recipe of its own. A separate
CI recipe would have to know which languages sit at which paths; inside the
language recipe, a monorepo gets the right jobs by construction, and the reusable
workflows already take a `working-directory` input.

## host

Language-blind. Each language recipe supplies its own jobs and setup action.

The shared quality and security jobs split across both. The host recipe runs
actionlint, zizmor, cspell, lychee, taplo, yamllint, markdownlint, and the secret
scan, none of which needs language knowledge.

The rest cannot live here:

| Step | Why it is language-dependent |
|---|---|
| lizard | complexity thresholds differ per language |
| CodeQL | takes a language list, and its names differ from ours (`javascript-typescript`, not `ts`) |
| trivy | filesystem mode against dependencies, configuration mode against IaC |
| OSV | keys off which lockfiles exist |

Each language recipe therefore drops `.github/quality.d/<lang>.yml` and
`.github/security.d/<lang>.yml`, and the shared workflow builds its matrix by
reading that directory at run time.

The security fragment also names the recipe's opengrep packs, which is the same inversion
applied to a ruleset: `lang/python` asks for `p/python`, `iac/terraform` for `p/terraform`,
and the discovery step unions them, deduplicated. `lang/ts` and `iac/cdk` both ask for
`p/typescript`, and passing it twice would run the same rules twice. An empty list is a
claim rather than a gap, which is what `lang/api` states: opengrep matches code constructs
and a contract is data.

`--sarif` writes to stdout and is redirected. `--sarif-output=FILE` is documented and
silently writes nothing: verified against opengrep 1.26.0, where the flag did not produce a file
while the same scan on stdout produced valid SARIF 2.1.0 carrying the finding. A workflow
trusting the documented flag uploads an empty file and reports a clean scan.

The scan runs without `--error`, so a finding does not end the job before the SARIF reaches
the security tab. A later step reads the file back and fails there. The GitLab job does pass
`--error`, because it has no upload to protect, and it reads the same
`.github/security.d/` fragments rather than a second copy: those are committed data rather
than a GitHub feature, and two copies would disagree about which rules run.

A `discover` job parses the fragments and emits the matrix as JSON, so a new
`lang/*` recipe contributes its jobs without the host recipe or a caller changing.
`discover` also emits a count per matrix, because a matrix of zero entries is a
workflow error rather than a skip, and a docs-only repository renders no language
recipe at all. A fragment states `codeql.supported: false` positively rather than
omitting the key, which is how `lang/rust` records that CodeQL has no Rust
extractor.

| Recipe | Writes | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `host/github` | `workflows/{wc-changes,wc-gate,wc-quality,wc-security}.yml`, `actions/ci-gate/`, `CODEOWNERS`, issue and pull-request templates, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | `security_contact`, `coc_contact`, `default_branch`, `job_timeout_minutes` |

### Governance lives in a script

`host/github` renders the governance files and ships `scripts/repo_govern.py` for the rest.
Measured against a live repository rather than assumed: `gh api repos/<slug>` reports every
merge and feature setting, a freshly created repository returned zero rulesets and
`Branch not protected`, and GitHub does not read a committed file for any of it. A recipe renders a
file, so the API surface is a script. `../rules/choices.md` carries the split.

`gate` is the only required check, `just repo-govern` applies the settings, and
`just repo-govern-check` reports differences without changing anything, which is what CI can
run. Environment secrets stay manual: a secret passed to a script is a secret in a shell
history.

`host/gitlab` was written rather than ported: bailiff had no GitLab CI package, only
`repo/gitlab-repo`, so its four language fragments had no pipeline to be included by.

Unlike `host/github`, it does not ship a governance script. The file-based half is there:
CODEOWNERS, the issue and merge request templates, and the three governance documents.

The rest is applied through the API:

| Applied by hand | Why not scripted |
|---|---|
| protected branches, protected tags | gated by instance version |
| approval rules, merge trains | gated by tier |
| push rules | gated by tier |

A script written against one instance would silently do less on another, so the recipe renders
the files and leaves those settings to a person. `psc-hfx` holds the decision.

The `stages:` list is generated from what the `.gitlab/ci/*.yml` fragments declare.
GitLab fails the whole pipeline when a job names a stage the list omits rather than
skipping that job, and the include is a glob, so a language recipe adopted later
contributes a fragment the list has to learn about. `quality` and `security` are
unconditional, because this recipe's own two jobs sit there. A stage no `STAGE_ORDER`
entry covers fails the generator, where the message can name the fragment.

Governance wording differs between the hosts, though the substance does not. GitLab
has merge requests rather than pull requests, and no private vulnerability reporting
form, so `SECURITY.md` points at a confidential issue instead. That is the private
channel a GitLab project has without extra configuration.

`host/github` also takes `project_name` and `org`, threaded from `base/repo` for
the clone line and `CODEOWNERS`. An empty `org` writes a commented-out rule rather
than `*  @`, which GitHub reports as a parse error on every pull request.

The pull-request template goes to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. One
template inside a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory applies only through a query
parameter, so it silently never loads.

`SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `CODEOWNERS` carry
`_skip_if_exists`: each holds a contact address or a project-specific rule edited
after rendering.
| `host/gitlab` | `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the generated stages list and the glob include, `.gitlab/{CODEOWNERS,issue_templates,merge_request_templates}`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `scripts/gen_gitlab_stages.py`, `.just.d/gitlab.just` | `gitlab_host`, `security_contact`, `coc_contact`, `default_branch`, `job_timeout_minutes` |

## quality

| Recipe | Writes | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `quality/hooks` | `.pre-commit.d/{hygiene,beads}.yaml`, the generated root `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.mise/conf.d/hooks.toml`, `.just.d/hooks.just`, `scripts/merge_hooks.py` | `hook_exclude_patterns`, `max_file_kb`, `commit_scopes` |

Every hygiene check is on. prek is the manager.

`default_install_hook_types` is computed from the stages the folded hooks declare
rather than fixed. `prek install` writes one shim per entry, so a stage missing
from that list is a hook that never fires and reports nothing. A language recipe
contributing a `pre-push` hook is what makes this necessary.

The merge runs from `scripts/merge_hooks.py` in the generated project, and the
copier task calls that same copy. A second copy here would let `just hooks-merge`
and the render fold fragments differently.

Conventional-commit checking uses `compilerla/conventional-pre-commit`, which
takes `--strict` to disallow `fixup!` and merge commits, `--force-scope`,
`--scopes <list>`, and positional custom types. It replaces a hand-written
74-line script. An empty `commit_scopes` drops `--force-scope`, which without an
allowlist demands a scope while accepting any spelling of it.

`.mise/conf.d/hooks.toml` pins betterleaks to 1.7.1 rather than the 1.7.2 that
GitHub lists. mise hides a release younger than its `minimum_release_age`, and
pinning the hidden one fails to install.

In a monorepo the language recipe writes each member's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
and prek unions them, so hooks travel with the language. `quality/hooks` then
carries the root config and the repository-wide hygiene hooks alone.

## workspace

| Recipe | Writes | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace/monorepo` | the workspace manifest (`[workspace] members`, uv workspace, bun workspaces, or one go module), `scripts/add_member.py`, `.just.d/monorepo.just` | `layout`, `members`, `project_name` |
| `workspace/just` | `justfile` carrying `setup`, the aggregates, and one `import?` per `.just.d/*.just`, plus `scripts/gen_justfile.py` and `.mise/conf.d/just.toml` | none |
| `workspace/moon` | `.moon/workspace.yml`, `.moon/toolchain.yml`, `moon.yml` per member, `.just.d/moon.just` | `members`, `layout` |
| `workspace/worktrunk` | `.config/wt.toml`, `.worktreeinclude` | `forge_platform`, `forge_hostname`, `worktree_includes` |

`workspace/monorepo` owns `just add`.

### moon alongside just, not instead of it

moon is the second task runner, not a replacement. `just` is the entry point a person
types and defines every repo-wide task with no member dimension. moon defines the member
graph underneath: it is the only thing here that models a dependency between members.

That distinction is what the recipe buys, and it is not caching. Measured on a
three-member chain where `core` is depended on by `api`, which is depended on by `web`:

| Scenario | moon | the equivalent `just` loop |
|---|---|---|
| cold | 3.37s | 3.48s |
| nothing changed | 0.10s | 3.37s |
| one leaf changed | 1.24s | 3.37s |

The `just` loop costs the same every run because it has no graph to consult. moon
rebuilds a dependent when its dependency changes and skips it when only a sibling
moved, which is a correctness property rather than a speed one: a hand-written loop
either reruns everything or risks using a stale artefact. `moon run web:build` also
orders `core`, then `api`, then `web` from one command, with that order written nowhere
in the recipes.

`moon.yml` is generated per member by `gen_moon.py`, which reads the root manifest's
glob and each member's own dependency declarations. Nothing about the graph is asked,
because an answer could disagree with the manifest. Each toolchain spells a sibling
differently, and every spelling is read: rust `{ path = "../core" }`, ts
`"ui": "workspace:*"`, python the requirement string `lib>=0.1.0`. go declares no
edges, since a member there is a package inside one module.

moon 2.x renamed keys that render cleanly and fail only when the CLI reads them:

- The workspace section is `pipeline`, not `runner`.
- `vcs.client`, not `vcs.manager`. The published `workspace.json` still documents
  `manager`, and moon 2.4.6 rejects it, so the CLI is what this follows.
- A project's kind is `layer`, where 1.x used `type`.
- The task variable is `$MOON_PROJECT_ID`. There is no `$MOON_PROJECT_NAME`, and it is
  the directory rather than the package name, so `cargo -p` gets the manifest's name
  written in literally instead.

An output path is member-relative, which is wrong for cargo: it writes to the workspace
root `target/`, so rust declares `/target/debug` with moon's workspace-relative prefix.
A path nothing creates makes moon warn and cache nothing, so python and go declare no outputs
at all: `uv sync` writes into a shared `.venv`, and `go build ./...` discards its binary.

Inputs are declared per toolchain too. `src/**/*` matches nothing in a go member, where sources
sit beside the package, so no edit would ever invalidate the build.

Each import is written `import?`, the optional form. Under the hard form a missing
file is a parse error that takes down every recipe in the justfile, so a fragment
deleted by hand would break `just` entirely rather than only its own recipes.

Every fragment shares one flat namespace, and just rejects a name defined twice.
Prefixing each `just` recipe with the fragment's own name is what keeps that from
happening. `gen_justfile.py` refuses a colliding set and names both fragments,
because just's own error breaks the whole file rather than the pair.

The aggregate recipes probe rather than depend. `check` and `each <phase>` ask
`just --show <name>` which per-language recipes exist, so one language renders and
one runs. A `needs:`-style dependency on a recipe no fragment provided is a parse
error, which is why `check` probes `hooks-all` rather than depending on it.

A fresh clone and a linked worktree need different work, so there are two recipes.

`setup` is for a clone: `mise trust` then `mise install`, each rendered language's
`<lang>-install`, then `hooks-install`. Trust comes first because an untrusted config
is skipped, after which `mise install` reads nothing and reports success.

`setup-worktree` is what `wt`'s blocking pre-start runs, and `setup_command` defaults to
it. `.worktreeinclude` copies `node_modules/` from the primary, so what it runs is
what a copy cannot provide, plus the language installs.

| Step | Why a worktree needs it |
|---|---|
| `mise trust` | a new directory is untrusted, and an untrusted config is skipped |
| `<lang>-install` | the user config excludes `.venv/` and `target/`, and an exclude beats an include, so those cannot be copied |
| `hooks-install` | a worktree's `$GIT_DIR` is `.git/worktrees/<name>/`, where git looks for its hooks, so shims in the primary never fire |

The language installs are close to free when a copy warmed them, well under a second for
each of uv, cargo, and go. They earn their place by catching a branch whose lockfile
moved, where the copied tree would otherwise build stale.

Both `just` recipes probe with `just --show` rather than declaring dependencies, since a
dependency on one that nothing rendered is a parse error.

`--git-dir` replaced a `core.hooksPath` override. prek declines to install while an
ambient global hooksPath is set, which a machine-wide hook manager leaves behind, and it
does not write a shim while printing only a note: a fresh clone silently had no hooks. Verified
on a machine with `git-defender`'s global path set, where the flag installed all six
shims and a bad commit message was blocked.

`workspace/worktrunk` sets `pre-merge = "just check"`, so a merge runs the same
gate CI does and cannot land what CI would reject. A project-defined command is
approved once and re-prompts when edited, so that line changing is visible.

Of the ten hooks worktrunk has, the recipe sets two. `pre-commit` is left to
prek, which installs the git-level hooks already. `post-commit`, `post-merge`, and
`pre-switch` describe work that belongs to CI or to the source worktree.
`pre-remove` would fire on every `wt merge`, since the user config sets
`remove = true`.

A dev server runs under `wt step tether`, whose teardown is automatic and needs no
`pre-remove` hook: the process group is signalled when the worktree goes. Its port
comes from `branch | hash_port`, which maps to 10000-19999 and is stable per
branch, so two worktrees never contend. `sanitize_db` does the same for a
per-branch database name.

`.worktreeinclude` names what a new worktree copies from the primary checkout. It
narrows rather than adds: a path is copied only when it is both gitignored and
listed. An exclude beats an include, and project excludes combine with the user's,
so a path the user config excludes cannot be recovered here.

Only `template-append` is honoured from a project `[commit.generation]`. The
command and the main template stay in user config, since they name which agent CLI
the developer has.

## release

| Recipe | Writes | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `release/release-please` | `release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`, the workflow, `.just.d/release.just` | `release_type`, `initial_version`, `default_branch`, `release_packages`, `release_app`, `sync_generated` |
| `release/cocogitto` | `cog.toml`, `.just.d/cog.just` | `initial_version`, `release_scopes` |
| `release/goreleaser` | `.goreleaser.yaml`, `.github/workflows/goreleaser.yml`, `.just.d/goreleaser.just`, plus the mise, gitignore, and quality fragments | `goreleaser_main`, `goreleaser_targets`, `goreleaser_version`, `go_version`, `goreleaser_sbom`, `syft_version` |
| `release/dep-updates` | `renovate.json`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, and the auto-merge workflow | `default_branch`, `auto_merge`, `renovate_timezone` |

Ecosystems follow from the language recipes. renovate covers the language
ecosystems; dependabot covers action versions, which is what the existing
auto-merge workflow in `astro-up.github.io` consumes.

Both tools render, rather than one or the other as bailiff offered. renovate disables
its own `github-actions` manager, because dependabot's `fetch-metadata` action reports
the semver level of a bump and renovate does not emit an equivalent. Enabling both would open
two pull requests per action version.

`pep621` is the manager covering a uv `pyproject.toml`. There is no `uv` manager, and a
name renovate does not know silently updates nothing.

The auto-merge workflow triggers on `pull_request` and gates on
`github.event.pull_request.user.login`. `github.actor` can be spoofed by pushing to a
branch dependabot opened, which zizmor reports as `bot-conditions` at high confidence,
and `pull_request_target` runs with a writable token in the base repository's context
for no benefit here. A major update always waits for a person.

`release-please` and `cocogitto` are alternatives rather than companions: cog bumps and
tags from a developer's working copy, release-please through a pull request CI merges,
and a repository selecting both would tag twice. A profile picks one.

release-please has no glob support. `packages` takes a literal path per package, and the
`node-workspace` and `cargo-workspace` plugins only build a dependency graph over what is
already configured, so a member absent from the config is never versioned, tagged, or
written into the changelog.

`just add` registers the member as part of creating it, which is the moment the path is
known. Nothing reconciles the list afterwards. Adding an entry drops the `"."` package,
because a workspace releases its members rather than its root and the two tags would
collide, and turns on `include-component-in-tag`, without which every member's tag
collides on one version number.

The recorded versions are release-please's own after the first release, so an entry
already present keeps its version. A new member joins at the version the others share, or
at `initial_version` when they disagree, so a repository releasing 2.x ships no 0.1.0
package.

### The release pull request needs an App token

A pull request opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger a workflow. GitHub refuses this on
purpose, so that a workflow cannot cause its own next run. The pull request release-please opens
therefore reports no checks, and a required check blocks it forever. Measured on this
repository: PR #2 came up with zero check runs against a required `gate`.

`release_app` mints a token from a GitHub App instead, which is not subject to that rule. It
needs two credentials on the repository:

| Name | Kind | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID` | variable | not sensitive, and keeping it visible makes a wrong-app failure readable |
| `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | secret | the App's signing key |

The default is off, since a scaffold cannot provision an App. With it off the workflow still
runs and still opens the pull request; merging it just needs an admin override. The workflow
says so beside the token it chose, rather than leaving the reader to discover it from a blocked
pull request.

With it on there is no fallback: a missing or empty credential fails the run. Falling back to
`GITHUB_TOKEN` would report success while producing a pull request nobody can merge, and the
failure would surface later as a blocked pull request with nothing pointing at the cause.

The check tests the key's length rather than its presence. An empty secret was written from an
`op read` whose 1Password session had timed out mid-pipe: the write reported success and stored
nothing, and every later run died inside `create-github-app-token` with `DataError: Invalid
keyData`, which reads as a malformed key rather than a missing one.

`sync_generated` amends the marketplace catalogs onto the release branch. release-please writes
the version into `apm.yml` and the manifest and stops there. Each catalog repeats that version
per package, so both go stale as soon as release-please opens its pull request, and `just
packages` fails on the drift. Measured on a two-package publisher: two differences, one
per package.

It needs `release_app`, because the amending commit has to trigger the required checks and only
an App-token commit does. Pushing that commit with `GITHUB_TOKEN` would leave a pull request
whose checks never ran.

release-please rewrites `apm.yml` to set `version`, and its YAML writer drops every comment in
the file. A repository whose manifest carries a rationale nobody can infer from the keys defines
a `release-restore` recipe, which the sync step calls after the bump and before the amend. That
call is guarded, so a repository with no comments to restore does not have to define one.

Blocking the release on the missing comment was the first attempt, and it was wrong: the
comments go missing on every release by construction, so the test blocked the pull request
that was supposed to carry the fix. Repairing beats refusing when the damage is predictable.

`persist-credentials: false` on the checkout, with the credential passed in the remote URL
instead. A token left in `.git/config` is what zizmor reports as `artipacked`, and it is
avoidable here, so the recipe avoids it rather than shipping a suppression file.

### release-please versions, goreleaser publishes

release-please computes the next version from the Conventional Commit subjects, writes
`CHANGELOG.md`, and pushes the tag. `release/goreleaser` triggers on that tag and attaches
what it built. Each tool covers what the other cannot, which is why they are separate
recipes.

`changelog.disable: true` and `release.mode: append` are what keep them from colliding: the
changelog already exists before the tag does, and generating a second one from the same
commits would publish two that disagree on formatting.

Verified against goreleaser 2.17.1 rather than read from its documentation. `checksums` is
rejected outright, since the key is `checksum` singular. A snapshot build produced four
cross-compiled binaries and a checksums file from one runner, and the extracted binary
reported the version `ldflags` injected, which is what makes a bug report traceable to a
build.

`CGO_ENABLED=0` is what allows one runner to build every target. The release workflow sets
`cache: false`, unlike every other Go job: a poisoned cache entry would end up inside a
binary users download, which zizmor reports as cache-poisoning, and a release is infrequent
enough that a cold module download costs seconds nobody waits on.

`go-lib` does not render this recipe. A Go library is consumed by module path and publishes no
artefact.

### SBOM and provenance

`goreleaser_sbom` is on by default and adds two things to a release: an SBOM per archive, and
a build provenance attestation over every published file.

The SBOM comes from goreleaser's own `sboms` block, which shells out to syft. Measured against
goreleaser 2.17.1 and syft 1.50.0: four archives produced four valid SPDX-2.3 documents of
about 3.8KB each, named `<archive>.sbom.json` beside their archive, with the cataloguing step
taking 36 seconds. `artifacts: archive` rather than `binary`, because the archive is what a
user downloads.

goreleaser does not install syft, so the workflow does. Without that step the release fails at
the cataloguing stage with the archives already built.

A pairing check runs before the attestation and fails when `dist/` does not hold an SBOM, because an
`sboms` block that produced nothing is a silent downgrade to no SBOM at all and the release
would otherwise succeed looking attested. Emptiness is tested with `${sboms[*]+x}` rather than
a length: under `set -u` an empty array reads as unbound on the runner's bash, which aborted
with `unbound variable` before reaching the message.

Provenance only, with no separate SBOM attestation. `actions/attest-sbom` warns that it is
deprecated in favour of `actions/attest`, and both take `sbom-path` as one file capped at 16MB
while goreleaser writes one per archive. A composite action cannot loop, so covering four
archives would need a matrix job, which means uploading and re-downloading `dist/` to attest
what the publishing job already holds. The SBOMs ship as release assets, and the provenance
subject list includes them.

The attestation runs after the publish, not before. Its subject is a digest, and a digest
exists only once the artefact does.

## docs

| Recipe | Writes | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/site` | `docs/site/{astro.config.mjs,package.json,src/}`, `.gitignore.d/site`, `.mise/conf.d/site.toml`, `.just.d/site.just` | `docs_engine`, `site_url`, `project_name`, `description`, `node_version`, `repo_url`, `sidebar_autogenerate` |
| `docs/agents` | `docs/agents/**`, the `AGENTS.md` body, the `CLAUDE.md` symlink | none |
| `docs/adr` | `docs/adr/{0000-template.md,index.md}` | `project_name` |
| `docs/deploy-sibling` | `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, which builds and deploys in place | `pages_repo`, `default_branch`, `job_timeout_minutes` |
| `docs/deploy-split` | `.github/workflows/docs-publish.yml`, which pushes the built output across | `pages_repo`, `deploy_key_secret`, `default_branch`, `job_timeout_minutes` |
| `docs/api-refs` | `docs/site/scripts/{gen-api-refs.mjs,check-api-refs-fresh.sh,extract-<lang>-api.*}`, `.just.d/api-refs.just` | `api_ref_languages`, `api_ref_section` |

`docs_engine` is `starlight` or `fumadocs`, and one renders at a time: the comparison is a
derived boolean, since a conditional filename holding a quote breaks jinja compilation.
fumadocs brings React as a real dependency, where starlight needs none.

`site_url` is mandatory. Without an explicit `site:` the Astro sitemap integration warns
and emits nothing, so the sitemap is silently absent. Verified by building a rendered site:
with it, `sitemap-index.xml` and a populated `sitemap-0.xml` were produced.

An empty `repo_url` omits the edit link and the source link rather than rendering a dead
one.

Selecting `docs/api-refs` forces `docs/deploy-split`. The generated pages live in the code
repo, so the repo that holds the source is the one that has to build and push them.

`api-refs` ships the harness and one stub per language, not working extractors. An extractor
is where a language's whole toolchain leaks in, and none of it generalises:

| Language | Constraint the stub records |
|---|---|
| rust | rustdoc's JSON is nightly-only and its schema changes between nightlies, so any pin the scaffold shipped would be the wrong one |
| python | griffe reads statically, which is what lets it document a module whose import has a side effect |
| ts | typedoc needs `--excludeInternal`, or it publishes everything a package exports for its own tests |

The prior art this replaced ran to 2,622 lines, carrying one project's `packages/python`
layout and one project's nightly pin. Each stub emits valid empty IR, so the harness is
testable before an extractor exists.

`gen-api-refs.mjs` owns the page shape. An extractor owns one language and communicates only
through the IR documented in that file's header. A symbol whose `doc` is empty fails the run,
since a reference page with empty descriptions reads as complete while documenting nothing.
Missing docs are collected and reported at once, because fixing them one run at a time is
the slowest possible order.

`check-api-refs-fresh.sh` checks two things:

- **Staleness.** `--check` renders to memory and writes nothing, so the gate cannot repair the
  drift it reports and pass on a rerun.
- **Determinism.** The generator runs twice and the outputs are compared. A renderer that
  iterates a hash map or embeds a timestamp makes every commit carry a reference diff, which
  makes the staleness check meaningless. With no extractor yet this step exits early, since a
  directory no render created is not evidence of nondeterminism.

Each deploy recipe writes its own workflow. Pages deployment needs `pages: write` and `id-token: write`,
which the gate does not carry, and both are scoped to the deploy job rather than the whole
workflow.

`concurrency` is grouped per ref in both. A global group would make two different refs
cancel each other, where per ref two pushes to one branch serialise and the later wins.

Both write `.nojekyll` into the built output. Pages applies Jekyll unless told not to,
which drops every directory whose name opens with an underscore, and Astro emits `_astro/`,
so the assets 404 and the pages render unstyled.

`deploy-pages` clamps its own poll timeout and ignores a longer one, so `deploy-sibling`
runs a first attempt under `continue-on-error` and retries in a second step against the
same artefact.

`deploy-split` sets `keep_files: false`, so a page deleted here disappears there, and
excludes `.github` from the replacement. Removing the sibling's own workflow would leave
nothing to trigger on the next push, and it would stop deploying without saying so. An
`on.push.paths` filter is safe on both, unlike a required check: nothing waits on a deploy
workflow to report a status.

## agentic

### `agentic/marketplace`: consumer-side install gate

| Recipe | Writes | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `agentic/package` | `<name>/{package.json, .omp-plugin/plugin.json, skills/<name>/SKILL.md}`, the `.omp-plugin/`, `.claude-plugin/`, and `.agents/plugins/` marketplace catalogs, `scripts/build_catalog.py`, `.just.d/package.just`, `.gitignore.d/package` | `project_name`, `package_name`, `description`, `author`, `owner` |
| `agentic/beads` | `.beads/` through `bd init --init-if-missing --skip-hooks --server`, plus `.gitignore.d/beads` and `.just.d/beads.just` | `bd_prefix`, `bd_storage_mode`, `bd_dolt_sync`, `bd_sync_remote`, `bd_auto_export`, `bd_dolt_auto_commit`, `bd_push_command` |
| `agentic/index` | `repomix.config.json`, `.gitignore.d/index`, `.just.d/index.just` | `index_languages`, `index_extra_ignores` |
| `agentic/marketplace` | `docs/agents/marketplaces.md`, `.copier-answers.marketplace.yml` | `marketplace_sources`, `marketplace_selection` |

`agentic/marketplace` records only user-approved `{handle, source}` pairs and the selected
plugins. Its replayable answer file is:

```yaml
marketplace_sources:
  - {handle: example, source: owner/repo}
marketplace_selection:
  mode: none | all | explicit
  scope: project | user
  plugins: []  # explicit mode uses qualified name@handle selectors
```

`none`, `all`, and `explicit` are the only modes. `none` selects nothing; `all` selects every
plugin in the approved sources; `explicit` accepts only qualified `name@handle` selectors from
those sources. `project` is the safe default scope; `user` is allowed only when the user
explicitly chooses machine-wide installation. An empty inventory is valid for `none` and `all`
and produces no install actions.

The adapter is read-only: `uv run scripts/marketplaces.py inventory` reads OMP's text marketplace
list/discover output and JSON installed inventory, and never registers or installs. It fails closed:

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| OMP unavailable or not executable | Refuse the gate |
| Approved handle is missing or its source changed | Refuse the gate as stale |
| Duplicate qualified selector | Refuse the gate |
| Explicit selector is unknown or unapproved | Refuse the gate |
| Empty inventory with `none` or `all` | Valid; emit no installs |

Before the install gate, run the adapter and review its JSON plus the generated
`docs/agents/marketplaces.md`. The human gate owns every mutating action: if approved, a human may
register an unregistered source with `omp plugin marketplace add <owner/repo>`, then run each
generated `omp plugin install <name>@<handle> --scope <project|user>` command. Claude uses
`/plugin marketplace add <owner/repo>`; Codex reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.

No per-harness configuration file is rendered. Which marketplaces a machine trusts is the user's
to state, so nothing here seeds one.

### `agentic/package`: a repository that is its own marketplace

The layer renders one starter plugin and the three catalogs that publish it, holding the
same bytes: OMP reads `.omp-plugin/marketplace.json` and falls back to
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, Claude Code reads the second, and Codex reads
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, so one repository serves all three from one source. The `agentic-repo` profile, the 17-repo shape with no language recipe, is where it
belongs. It grows to many plugins by adding directories, each with a manifest.

What the runtimes require, measured on a 31-plugin estate:

- A capability is located by path, and no catalog entry redirects the lookup:
  `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` without recursion, `agents/<name>.md`, `commands/<name>.md`,
  `rules/<name>.md`.
- Rules and agents load only for a plugin OMP recognises, and recognition is a
  `package.json` carrying an `omp` key. Without one, `omp plugin doctor` reports "not an omp
  plugin" and both are silently absent while the plugin's skills still load. The key may be
  empty: it is a marker, not a payload.
- OMP identifies a capability by its bare `name`, deduplicates across every configured
  source, and keeps the first match, so a name two plugins share resolves to one and hides
  the other. Every name carries its plugin as a prefix, and `scripts/build_catalog.py`
  refuses a capability that does not.
- OMP compares `plugins[].version` in the top-level catalog, so an entry with no version is
  invisible to its upgrade check. Each plugin owns its version in
  `<plugin>/.omp-plugin/plugin.json`, and the catalog aggregates them.

The catalogs are committed generated artefacts, which is what lets an install resolve the
marketplace from a clone with no build step. `scripts/build_catalog.py` is their only
writer: a copier task runs it at render time, `just marketplace-build` reruns it, and `just
marketplace-check` compares the committed bytes and writes nothing, so the gate cannot
repair the drift it reports. That check runs from the host layer's `Generated files current`
step, beside `just-check`: same class of failure, a generated file a change made stale.

Registering a marketplace is machine-global rather than per project. `omp plugin marketplace
add <owner>/<repo>` writes under `~/.omp/`, so no template can seed it and none tries;
which marketplaces a machine trusts is the user's to state, and a rendered repository
asserts nothing about it.

release-please keeps its single-component shape here, and this layer writes none of its
files. It bumps only what its config names, and the plugin manifests are not among them, so
a version bump reaches the catalogs through `just marketplace-build`. A marketplace past its
first plugin points the config at each manifest and turns on `sync_generated`, which amends
the regenerated catalogs onto the release branch.

Which marketplaces a machine registers is the user's decision, collected in the
interview and never defaulted: a scaffold suggesting its author's own catalogs is a
recommendation nobody asked for. Registration is machine-global -- `omp plugin
marketplace add` writes under `~/.omp/`, Claude Code's `/plugin marketplace add`
under `~/.claude/plugins/`, and Codex reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` --
so the skill reports each command behind the run's install gate rather than any
recipe running one.

All three runtimes were probed live against a throwaway catalog. `omp plugin
marketplace add` accepted a repository carrying only
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, installed a pure Claude-format plugin, and a
fresh session loaded its skill. `codex plugin marketplace add` read
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` -- its own listing names that path as the
snapshot source -- and `codex plugin add <plugin>@<marketplace>` installed the
same plugin, whose skill a fresh `codex exec` then reported available. Two
boundaries carry the whole compatibility story:

- Rules and agents load in OMP only for a plugin whose `package.json` carries the
  `omp` marker; its skills load regardless.
- Claude hooks are inert in OMP, whose CLI contains no `hooks.json` handling at all.

A plugin that leans on hooks or unmarked rules therefore serves one runtime and
silently under-delivers in the other -- which is why this recipe's starter ships
both manifests and the marker.

`agentic/index` commits its include and ignore patterns to `repomix.config.json`,
which repomix reads natively. They are then visible to anyone reading the repository.

Path filtering is the only lever that works. Measured against a 1,269-file
repository, the include and ignore pair cut a pack by 30.7 percent. The content
flags did not. `--remove-comments` takes 13.6 percent, and deletes every `//` and `#` with
it, so safety notes and invariants go too.

`--compress` depends on whether its parser knows the language, which makes it a second recipe
rather than a flag on the first. Measured over this scaffold's python sources it cut 27,215
bytes to 14,321, a 47 percent reduction. Over its jinja templates it grew the pack by 0.1
percent, because it cannot parse them. `just pack-code` is the recipe that uses it;
`--remove-empty-lines`, `--no-file-summary`, and `--truncate-base64` take nothing;
`--style json` and `--parsable-style` make the output 10 percent larger.

One artefact, searched rather than read. A pack of a 4,107-file repository is 6.3
million tokens, roughly six context windows, so reading it cannot succeed; `rg` over it
lists every path in 0.009s and finds one in 0.010s, against 0.126s for the equivalent
walk of the live tree.

A separate metadata-only map was tried and dropped. It answered nothing the pack could
not, and keeping one artefact removes repomix's `--no-files` trap: there is no `--files`,
so a config setting `files: false` cannot be overridden from the command line, and a
recipe pointing at such a config produces a metadata-only pack while calling itself
full.

Guarding the pack read is a plugin concern, not a render concern: a hook that denies a
whole-file read of `repomix-full.xml` ships in marketplace plugins, and which
marketplace supplies it is the user's choice. This recipe ships no hook.

The pack needs its own config file. repomix has `--no-files` but no `--files`, so
the map's `files: false` cannot be overridden from the command line, and one
config would silently produce a metadata-only pack. Both configs set the same
`include` and `ignore`, or the pack would index what the map hides.

The index artefacts are ignored, repomix's own default output names among them.
An unignored artefact is packed into the next one, which measured 38 percent of one
repository's whole pack, and `graphify update` has no output flag so it writes into
the tree regardless.

Holding architecture decisions as beads is a separate package, `adr-as-beads`: a
`decision` bead is the record and `.pre-commit.d/adr.yaml` renders it to
`docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`. That fragment renders unconditionally and no-ops without
`bd`, so a repository that has not adopted it pays nothing.

The renderer also rewrites the row block in `docs/adr/index.md`, between two markers.
Without that the index `docs/adr` ships keeps its placeholder row while numbered files
accumulate beside it, so the first artefact a reader opens reports no decisions. Only
the rows are generated: the prose above them is the project's, a hand-written record
takes a row below the block, and an index with no markers is left untouched rather than
injected into, because `docs/adr` may not have rendered at all.

A rendered record opens with its frontmatter. A leading HTML comment pushes `---` off line
one, and a parser then reads the block as body text. `status`, `date`, and `bead` go invisible
to anything indexing the records, so the provenance note follows the block instead.

`agentic/beads` runs `bd init --skip-hooks` and keeps everything else bd writes.
Neither flag is an answer: `--skip-hooks` is always passed and `--skip-agents` never
is, so no answer can turn the compaction hooks off. bailiff's version passed
`--skip-agents` unconditionally.

It renders after `docs/agents`, because bd appends a marked
`BEGIN BEADS INTEGRATION` block to an existing `AGENTS.md` and leaves the `CLAUDE.md`
symlink alone. With neither present it writes its own beads-only file instead, which
would then be what the repository's agents read first.

The properties it sets come from surveying every repository here that uses beads.
`sync.remote` is the only one all five set, and it carries a `git+ssh://` or
`git+https://` prefix, which is what marks it a Dolt remote over the git transport
rather than a plain one. An empty answer derives it from the git origin, normalising an
scp-style address first. `export.auto` is set in slopvac, `dolt.auto-commit: batch` in
platevault, and `repos.additional` in skymath for cross-repository hydration.

`metrics.*` and `no-git-ops` are set in the user's own `~/.config/bd/config.yaml`, so no
recipe writes them. `metadata.json` holds bd's generated `project_id` and database name,
which are per-clone rather than per-template.

bd also appends four ignore patterns to the root `.gitignore` under a header with no
end marker. `base/gitignore` rebuilds that file from `.gitignore.d/`, so the task
moves those lines into a fragment; left in place they survive until the next render
and then vanish.

bd installs two separate sets. Its git hooks are five 1.3KB shims running
`bd hooks run <event>` for `pre-commit`, `post-merge`, `post-checkout`,
`pre-push`, and `prepare-commit-msg`; `quality/hooks` reproduces those as local
prek entries, since prek supports the five stages these use. What made `--skip-hooks`
necessary was the ambient hook binaries copied in alongside them.

What each event earns, from bd's own git-integration reference:

| Event | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pre-commit` | exports `.beads/issues.jsonl` when `export.auto` is set, so it is committed alongside the change |
| `prepare-commit-msg` | adds an `Executed-By:` trailer when an agent made the commit |
| `post-merge` | imports JSONL as a legacy fallback; with `sync.remote` set, `bd dolt pull` is the real sync |
| `post-checkout` | runs chained hooks |
| `pre-push` | runs chained hooks |

None of them pushes the database. Every workflow in bd's documentation runs
`bd dolt push` by hand before `git push`, and running each event directly produced no
output and no push. The issues would therefore stay on one machine.

`quality/hooks` adds `scripts/bd-dolt-push.sh` at `pre-push` to close that. A commit is
local, so a git push is the moment the database has to follow; pushing per commit would be
work nobody is waiting on.

It never blocks. An unreachable remote or a missing wrapper reports and exits 0, since
`bd dolt push` is recoverable by running it again and blocking would make an offline
push impossible. With no `sync.remote` configured it exits before doing anything.

bd's own `dolt.auto-push` stays off. It pushes after a write on a five-minute debounce,
which leaves a window where the remote is behind and nothing reports it, and its
documentation warns that concurrent pushes to a git-protocol remote "can corrupt or
strand remote history" with more than one writer. It also ignores
`custom.bd-push-command`, so on a machine needing the wrapper it would hang every write
until its timeout. The hook pushes at the one moment that matters instead.

The push command is read from `custom.bd-push-command` rather than assumed to be `bd`.
Where the database runs in a container a direct `bd dolt push` hangs until it times out,
and that key names the wrapper that works. `custom.*` is bd's namespace for user-defined
keys, so this is a local convention rather than something bd reads itself.

Its agent hooks come in two more sets, both kept as bd writes them. Four codex
lifecycle entries in `.codex/hooks.json` run `bd codex-hook` on `SessionStart`,
`UserPromptSubmit`, `PreCompact`, and `PostCompact`. One Claude entry in
`.claude/settings.json` runs `bd prime --hook-json` on `SessionStart`.

Those hooks reload beads context after compaction, which is what makes an
`AGENTS.md` carrying no beads prose safe. `--skip-agents` would remove them and
is therefore not used.

## container

| Recipe | Writes | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `container/image` | `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `.just.d/container.just`, the mise, hook, CI, and security fragments | `container_language`, `container_runtime_base`, `registry`, `expose_port`, `trivy_severity`, `container_attest` |

`docs/architecture.md` carries the measured base image policy and the build-scan-push
order. The recipe's own `Dockerfile` repeats the measurement beside the `FROM` line, so the
reason for the base is where the choice is made.

Only hadolint runs at commit time. Building an image takes minutes and needs a daemon, so
the build and the image scan are CI. `trivy` runs twice against different things: `config`
mode reads the Dockerfile in the language-blind security workflow, and `image` mode reads
the built image in this recipe's own job.

`container_attest` is on by default and attests the pushed image's provenance. The subject is
the digest the registry returned, taken from the push step's own output, rather than a tag: a
tag is mutable, so an attestation bound to one says nothing about what a puller receives
later. `push-to-registry` stores the bundle beside the image, which is what lets
`gh attestation verify oci://...` work for someone holding the image and not the repository.

The step is gated on the push, since a pull request builds without publishing and there is no
digest to bind.

This job sets `cache: false` on mise, unlike every other mise-action call in the scaffold. It
pushes an image users pull, so a poisoned cache entry would end up inside that image. zizmor
reported exactly that against this workflow at high severity before the change. Only hadolint
and just come from mise here, so a cold install costs seconds. `release/goreleaser` sets the
same flag on setup-go.

## iac

| Recipe | Writes | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `iac/terraform` | `infra/{bootstrap,modules,envs,tests}`, `.tflint.hcl`, `.pre-commit.d/terraform.yaml` | `environments`, `aws_region`, `state_bucket` |
| `iac/cdk` | `.projenrc.ts` with `runner: tsx()`, `app: npx tsx`, and `github: false`, plus `.just.d/cdk.just` and the mise, gitignore, and security fragments | `cdk_version`, `projen_version`, `tsx_version`, `node_version` |

`environments` defaults to `[dev, prod]`.

### The ts-node trap has two call sites, not one

`projenrcTsOptions.runner: TypeScriptRunner.tsx()` governs only how `.projenrc.ts`
itself executes. projen writes `cdk.json`'s `app` separately, as
`npx ts-node -P tsconfig.json --prefer-ts-exts src/main.ts`, so with the runner set and
`app` left alone `npx projen` passed and `cdk synth` still failed. Both are overridden.

Reproduced rather than assumed, against projen 0.101.22: under TypeScript 7.0.2 the
default ts-node runner throws inside `findAndReadConfig`, and after both overrides
`npx projen` and `cdk synth` each exit 0.

`packageManager` is set explicitly too. projen otherwise defaults to `yarn_classic` and
warns that the option will become required, and nothing else here uses yarn.

### One root module, not one per environment

`infra/` is one root module. An environment is a pair of files under
`infra/envs/`, `<env>.tfbackend` and `<env>.tfvars`, rather than a directory of its
own.

This follows from the two decisions `architecture.md` fixes. Partial backend
configuration through `-backend-config=envs/<env>.tfbackend` configures one
`backend "s3" {}` block, which presupposes one root module, and `tofu test` reads
`tests/` under the root module, so `infra/tests/` is found only from there. An
earlier version of the row above said `envs/<env>`, which contradicted both: that
shape needs `-test-directory` on every test run, and it repeats the provider and
backend blocks per environment, which is the repetition partial configuration
removes.

The corollary is that a child module's source is `./modules/<name>`. `tofu test`
resolves a module source from the root module rather than from the test file, so
the `../` form fails under plan and test alike.

`bootstrap` is the exception, a second root module keeping local state, because it
creates the bucket the first one stores its state in.

### Tool requirements, measured

| Constraint | Consequence if ignored |
|---|---|
| tflint does not read a parent directory's config | every directory lints with the default rules, reporting findings `.tflint.hcl` disabled |
| tflint's failure threshold is error | a run exits 0 having printed real warnings |
| `tflint --init` needs a GitHub token | 403 rate limit, then "Plugin not found" per directory |
| `terraform_required_version` covers child modules | the lint gate fails on `modules/*` |
| pre-commit-terraform prefers `terraform` over `tofu` | the hooks run terraform against an OpenTofu repository |
| the hook ids are `terraform_*`, and tflint's is `terraform_tflint` | prek rejects the fragment on an unknown id |
| just shares jinja's `{{ }}` | an unwrapped fragment loses every recipe parameter |

Each was found by rendering the recipe and running the tool, not by reading the
template.

## Render order

```
base/repo precheck
<generator>            single repo only: cargo new, uv init, go mod init, bun init
base/license
base/repo
workspace/monorepo     monorepo: the root manifest, then the generator per member
lang/*
host/{github,gitlab}
release/*  iac/*  docs/*
agentic/{package,beads}
quality/hooks
workspace/just
workspace/moon         monorepo only: the member graph, after every member exists
base/gitignore
```

The generator runs before every recipe. `cargo init` writes no `license` key and
`uv init` writes its own `pyproject.toml`, so a language recipe patches an
existing manifest rather than creating one.

`workspace/monorepo` precedes `lang/*` so the manifest exists before members render.

The generator's position depends on the shape. In one repository it runs first,
against the repository root, and a language recipe patches the manifest it wrote. In a
monorepo it cannot: `cargo init .` writes a `[package]` root, `workspace/monorepo`
then skips the file it finds, and no `[workspace]` section is ever written, so the
repository silently is not a workspace. Verified by rendering in that order.

A monorepo therefore renders the root manifest first and runs the generator per member,
which is what `just add` does. Members resolve through the manifest's glob, so a
directory created under it is a member with no edit to the root: confirmed against
cargo, uv, and bun, and go does not need a registration because a member is a directory in
one module.

`agentic/beads` follows `docs/*` because bd appends to an existing `AGENTS.md` and
writes its own beads-only one when none exists. The order is what decides which file
a repository's agents read first.

`quality/hooks` follows `iac/*` because it folds `.pre-commit.d/*` into the root
config, and `iac/terraform` contributes a fragment. Rendering it earlier would
leave that fragment out, with nothing to report the omission: prek reads the merged
file and never sees the fragment directory.

Re-rendering any fragment-contributing recipe therefore needs the merge again.
`just hooks-install` and `just hooks-all` both run it first, so the config cannot
lag the fragments.

`workspace/just` and `base/gitignore` aggregate what earlier recipes contributed,
so they follow every contributor including `agentic/*`: beads adds an ignore for
`.beads/dolt/` and a `.just.d/beads.just`.

Both of the generated files can therefore go stale when a recipe is adopted later.
`just just-check` and `just hooks-all` catch each case, and the quality workflow runs
the first, so a pull request cannot merge a justfile that omits a fragment. Both
compare in a copy rather than rewriting, since a check that fixes what it checks
leaves a dirty tree and passes on the rerun.

A profile states this order directly. 31 recipes with a fixed order need no
dependency solver.

## Profiles

`profiles/*.yml` names, per shape, its recipe set in render order, its generator, the
answers fixed or derived for it, and the commands that prove a rendered tree builds.
`profiles/README.md` carries the format and the survey counts.

Thirteen shapes, matching the generator table in `../docs/architecture.md`.
`scripts/scaffold.py check` validates each against `recipes/`, and `just profiles-build`
renders each into a temporary directory and runs its own build.

That check is worth its runtime. A tree that renders is not a project that builds, and it caught
two ordering bugs no unit test did:

- `lang/api` declared `after: host/github` while `host/github` declares `after: lang/*`,
  a cycle no profile could satisfy. Every other language recipe renders before the host,
  because the host's matrix discovers the fragments they contribute.
- `rust-gui` put `workspace/moon` after `workspace/just`, so the justfile's import block
  never learned about `.just.d/moon.just`. The rendered tree then failed
  `just just-check`.

The second is why the validator checks aggregation separately from each recipe's own
`after`. A contributor has to precede its aggregator, and `workspace/just` cannot express
that by naming every present and future contributor in its own list.

A build command asserts only what the recipes produce. `scaffold render` does not run the
generator, since `cargo new` and `create-better-t-stack` reach the network or need a
toolchain the machine may lack, so `cargo build` there would fail for a missing manifest
rather than for anything a recipe got wrong.

### Integration cases

A profile covers one shape and a unit test covers one recipe. Neither covers what happens when
two recipes meet, which is where the ordering bugs above came from. `tests-integration/` holds
that middle ground: a case names a recipe set, an order, and a build, and `just integration`
renders each into a scratch tree and runs it.

| Case | The interaction |
|---|---|
| `layer-added-after-aggregator` | a language recipe adopted after `workspace/just` leaves the import block stale |
| `monorepo-rust-two-members` | two members added through `add_member.py`, and whether the second replaces the first's mise fragment |
| `both-hosts-mirrored` | both hosts over one language recipe, each folding the same fragments into its own generated file |
| `retrofit-onto-existing` | recipes over a populated tree, and which side wins |

Out of `just check` on purpose. A case renders a whole tree and runs its build, and a gate slow
enough to skip is worse than a suite someone has to remember. `tests/test_integration_cases.py`
reads the case files without rendering, so a mistyped recipe or a case duplicating a profile
fails in the fast suite instead.

Each case states in `gap` what is not already covered, because a case that repeats a profile
costs minutes and proves nothing. Verified by breaking each one: removing the resync fails
`layer-added-after-aggregator`, and dropping `README.md` from `base/repo`'s `_skip_if_exists`
fails `retrofit-onto-existing`.

## Steering generation

`docs/agents` ships `scripts/gen_steering.py`, which fills the marked blocks in
`docs/agents/` from what is on disk. `docs/steering.md` carries the ownership table; the
generator implements the generated half.

A pure function of the tree. Nothing is asked, because an answer could disagree with the
files an agent will actually read, and nothing reaches the network, so
`just steering-check` can gate it in CI.

| Reads | Produces |
|---|---|
| `justfile` and `.just.d/*` | the command surface in `index.md` |
| `.mise/conf.d/*.toml` | the toolchain pin table |
| each language recipe's tool config | one `quality/<lang>.md` leaf, plus its index row |
| `.github/workflows/*` | the job list and the gate's role |
| `release-please-config.json` | the tool and the real tag shape |
| the workflows and the Dockerfile | variable names, never values |

Both markers carry the block name: `<!-- END GENERATED: index -->`, not a bare
`<!-- END GENERATED -->`. A generator matching the bare form finds nothing, writes an empty
block, and reports that it wrote the file.

A file with no marker is never written after it is first created, which is what keeps
`conventions.md` and each leaf's "why a rule is off" section. `--check` reports drift
without repairing it, so the gate cannot destroy a hand edit and pass on the rerun.

Adding a language adds `quality/<lang>.md` and one index row. No existing file grows, which
is the property `docs/steering.md` asks for.

## Linting this repository

`just lint` covers the python and the prose. `just lint-config` covers the structural
surface: yamllint, taplo, JSON parsing, actionlint, and zizmor.

Both run in `just check`. The recipes put these tools in a generated project's CI, and a
scaffold that does not run them on itself has 87 unchecked YAML files and a workflow nobody
audits, which is what this repository had until the gate existed.

They skip `recipes/`. A `.jinja` file is deliberately not valid YAML, TOML, or JSON: it
holds jinja delimiters, and a conditional filename is not a path a parser accepts. The recipe
tests cover those instead, by rendering the template and running the real parser against the
result.

## Running the tests

Most tests render a recipe and run the real tool against the result, which is what catches
the defects a template read cannot. That makes the suite wait on toolchains rather than on
CPU, and each test renders into its own `tmp_path` without shared state, so it parallelises
cleanly.

| Command | Measured on 14 cores |
|---|---|
| `just test` | 160s, 543 passing |
| `just test-serial` | 889s, for a readable failure or a debugger |
| `just test-fast` | skips what installs an npm tree, builds an image, or compiles a crate |

A test that shells out to something expensive carries `@pytest.mark.slow`. An npm install
or a container build dominates a run otherwise, and the cdk fixture is session-scoped for
the same reason: its install and synth cost about 40 seconds and every test reading it only
reads.

| `.gitlab/ci/<name>.yml` | GitLab's `include: local:` glob |

### The agentic hooks with a git event

Three of the thirteen agentic-packages hooks act on a git action, and those move into
`.pre-commit.d/git-actions.yaml`. As PreToolUse hooks they fire only for an agent whose
harness is configured; as prek entries in a committed config they fire for every committer and
survive an agent running without that config.

| Hook | Stage | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `normalize-close-keywords` | `commit-msg` | rewrites the message in place |
| `attribution-guard` | `commit-msg` | advisory, prints and exits 0 |
| `no-force-push-to-default` | `pre-push` | refuses a non-fast-forward |

`Closes #1, #2, #3` closes only `#1`, because GitHub binds a closing keyword to the first
issue in a list. The rewrite distributes it so the rest close too, verified end to end through
prek's `commit-msg` stage.

The attribution guard prints rather than blocking. A commit message is trivially fixable and a
denied commit costs more than a nudge; the enforcing copy is the `commits` job in the quality
workflow, which reads the whole pull request range. Its patterns are vendored rather than
rewritten, because they carry recorded false-positive fixes: the bare
`users.noreply.github.com` domain was removed after an ordinary human co-author trailer was
reported as AI attribution.

The rest are unchanged, and the fragment records why beside the three that moved.
`hooks-quality` fires on an edit, which git never sees. `reset --hard`, `clean -fd`, and
`checkout --` are pre-execution guards: by the time a git hook runs, the work is already gone.
Only the force-push guard has an event, and `pre-push` is it.

A pre-push hook receives its refs on stdin and cannot see the `--force` flag, so the guard
compares ancestry instead: a non-fast-forward push means the remote commit is not an ancestor
of the local one.

### Hook fragments

In a monorepo each package gets a real `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and prek's
workspace mode unions them with hooks namespaced `<dir>:<hook-id>`. Nothing
merges.

In one directory two language recipes cannot both write the root config, so
`just hooks-merge` concatenates `.pre-commit.d/*.yaml`. prek skips dot-prefixed
directories during discovery, so the fragment directory is invisible to it until
that recipe runs.

## Cross-recipe reads

Two, both through `_external_data`, which resolves against the destination:

| Recipe | Reads | For |
|---|---|---|
| `lang/rust` | `base/license` | the SPDX identifier for `Cargo.toml`, without which `cargo-deny` fails against the crate itself |
| `docs/deploy-*` | `docs/site` | the engine and the site URL |

The other shared values are threaded by the agent, which writes one answers file
per recipe.

## Dropped

| Package | Reason |
|---|---|
| `hooks/manager` | prek is the manager; lefthook rewrites the configured hooks path |
| `agentic/agentic` | per-harness configuration comes from a marketplace |
| `agentic/agent-hooks` | same |
| `docs/mkdocs` | starlight and fumadocs cover it |
| `docs/starlight` | replaced by `docs/site`, which does not need a TypeScript project |
| `iac/cloudformation` | absent from every repository surveyed |
| `repo/gitlab-repo` | folded into `host/gitlab` |
| `repo/package-add` | replaced by `just add`, owned by `workspace/monorepo` |
